Openresty is just an enhancement of nginx. If you are familliar with nginx you will feel right at home with openresty. This is a hello_wrold example to illustrate how to write openresty scripts. The first thing to understand here is the file structure. Here is a high level overview


```
root
 -logs
 -conf

``` 
All the nginx configuration files go within the `conf` folder and all the logging goes in the `logs` folder. Easy right? This structure will not only do for our simple example but will hold well for complex exapmles that we will work on later.
