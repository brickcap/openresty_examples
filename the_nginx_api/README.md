Ah the nginx API. This is where the magic happens. 
Remember all those `by_lua` directives that we talk about in the last chapter? 
They are all just there to execute lua api for nginx. In the words of the
author of ngx_lua 

> The various *_by_lua and *_by_lua_file configuration directives 
serve as gateways to the Lua API within the nginx.conf file


The nginx api is available in the form of two packages 
`ngx` and `ndk`. These packages are in the global scope by default 
and are always available to the lua directives. Which clears up a few
things for us. Remember how in `*_by_lua_file` directives we
could simply call the methods on `ngx` package even without requiring it?
As you can probably infer, the reason for it was that the `ngx` package
was already availaible to the directive globally. So there
was no need for us to `require` it.
